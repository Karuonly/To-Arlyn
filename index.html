                        &emsp; On behalf of the entire 10-Regina Sacratissimi Rosarii, first thank you for the time and effort you put sa mga reviewer para sa mga quizzes and exam na mahirap and also for guiding or teaching confused students in our class about a certain topic of a lesson and in solving mathematical equation that cannot be understand by most of the students in our class. We appreciate your leadership sa mga group project na sobrang rami na palagi tumatama sa exam, guidance sa mga gagawin kapag may project na kasama ang buong classroom, your unquestionable patience sa mga hindi sumusunod at maiingay, and sa effort you have put towards us in one way or the other, may it be academically or personally.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  You became an inspiration and a mentor to our classmates and to the next ates and kuyas of junior highschool. We appreciate how you tackled problems in our classroom and keep everyone moving in the right direction. We appreciate all the effort you have devoted to these. We truly wish you the best in all your endeavors, and all the happiness life has to offer in the future. We hope that you will have opportunities in National High School and can still compete in school competitions or in out of school competitions.

                        
                        Once again, thank you for everything. You will stay with us in our memories and we will not forget the time you spent with us at SRSPC.

                        
P.S.  Hope you find Yosh, James, Belle, Wyatt, at iba pang nating kaklase natin dati and also find new friend in your Senior High School journey and get accepted to your favorite college/university
